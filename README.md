# Coffee-Sales-Dashboard - Excel Project

# Project Overview

I successfully completed an end-to-end Excel-based project focused on creating a dynamic coffee sales dashboard. This project demonstrates data gathering, transformation, and visualization using pivot tables and pivot charts. The final dashboard presents key sales insights, including:

# Total sales over time segmented by coffee type.

# Sales by country (U.S., Ireland, and the UK).

# Top five customers.

The project leverages advanced Excel functions, such as XLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, and IF() statements, to retrieve and manage data dynamically. Additionally, interactive elements like slicers and timelines allow to filter and analyze data effectively.

# Data Gathering & Transformation

# Data Collection

Customer Data: Retrieved using XLOOKUP (applied three times to extract relevant fields).

Product Data: Extracted using INDEX-MATCH, implemented dynamically to populate all columns with a single formula.

Handling Missing Values: Used IF() to replace missing email addresses with blank values:

=IF(XLOOKUP(C9,customers!$A$1:$A$1001,customers!$C$1:$C$1001,,0)=0, "", XLOOKUP(C9,customers!$A$1:$A$1001,customers!$C$1:$C$1001,,0))

# Data Formatting & Cleaning

Applied custom date formatting (dd-mmm-yyyy) to ensure clarity across international date formats.

Formatted unit price and sales columns for better readability.

Checked for duplicate values to maintain data integrity.

Standardized coffee names using multiple IF() statements.

# Data Transformation into Pivot Table

The transformed data was converted into an Excel pivot table.

Pivot charts were created to visually represent key sales metrics.

Interactive elements like slicers and timelines were added to enhance user experience.
